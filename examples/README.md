# DataSift PHP Client Library Examples

The examples in this folder have been designed to demonstrate the most common
use cases. This file contains a brief description of each example.

Please note that running these examples will incur DPU costs against your account.

Unless stated otherwise all of the examples use the username and API key in config.php.

## consume-stream.php

This example shows the basic structure of a streaming client. It takes one or more stream hashes on the command line and consumes them all down a single multi-stream connection displaying the details of events as they occur.

    php consume-stream.php 0a4c11d2e90ddee8483e2c68061cbbf5

## deletes.php

Correct handling of delete notifications is a requirement of your data usage agreement with DataSift. This example demonstrates how delete notifications will be received by your code.

    php deletes.php

## dpu.php

All usage of the DataSift platform incurs costs in units of DPU. This example shows how to retrieve a breakdown of the DPU cost for a given stream. You can either supply the CSDL on the command line (as the first argument so it must be properly escaped) or you can pipe it to the command.

    cat football.csdl | php dpu.php

## football.php

You might want to collect a sample of data from a given stream, and that's what the football example demonstrates. The stream looks for anything containing the word "football" and outputs them as they are received. Once it has received ten interactions it stops the consumer and exits.

    php football.php

## football-buffered.php

This example does the same as football.php but it uses API calls to get the data rather than a streaming connection.

    php football-buffered.php

## historics.php

This script is a utility for calling the individual commands in the historics folder. To use it you pass in your username and API key, followed by the command you want to run and the arguments that command expects.
